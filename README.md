## [Highly recommended]
For the first time, go to "Settings-Cloud-Cloud Sync Mode" to set the synchronization mode to completely manual, and the plug-in will completely take over the synchronization awareness, which will provide a better user experience and effectively resolve conflict issues.
## Plug-in Introduction 
The main function is to realize S3/WEBDAV synchronization awareness when an unofficial subscription is made. At the same time, it can also optimize and accelerate the synchronization function of an official subscription.
## Usage Tutorial
First switch to full manual synchronization. If you don't know anything, open the plug-in settings (mobile enables browser access, and then switch to computer mode to modify), fill in the "Central Awareness Key" of all your devices as the same, and then click Save, then click Save, and you will be done
## Future plans
Distributed node awareness
